At the core of our programmes is a framework that has served as the guiding principle of all the work that we do:
#### HEARTS

HEARTS represents five key pillars:

> **H** is about providing Holistic development of the people we work with
> 
> **E** is the Empowerment of the community to be the change they want to see
> 
> **A** is the Amplification of our strengths to do good through partnerships
> 
>**R** is about ensuring our Responsiveness to the needs of the community
>
>**T** refers to the Thoughtfulness we embed in our programmes in attaining desired outcomes
>
>**S** represents the Stories that we hope to tell in order to inspire others.

An interconnected vision comprising three core pillars—Nurturance, Relationships and Care—the HEARTS framework embraces an approach that combines the grit of sports in order to nurture positive relationships.

Sports promotes respect, resilience, discipline and integrity. These are values that bring out the best in people. We believe that by working through sports and promoting these values, we can help our constituents nurture positive relationships with the people around them. This, in turn, strengthens empathy, self-motivation, care and promotes a deep appreciation of diversity, qualities that will instil a deeper sense of belonging in the community, boost their confidence and grow their potential as an individual.

By providing our coaches, trainers and community volunteers with adequate training, we engage the underprivileged more meaningfully and create relevant avenues for them to best express themselves through sport. 

At SportCares, we are more than just practitioners of sport-based social development and community building programmes—we are educators with a heart.  

As a result, we fully embrace the responsibility that comes along with providing the vulnerable a safe space to hone their craft and nurture their abilities.
