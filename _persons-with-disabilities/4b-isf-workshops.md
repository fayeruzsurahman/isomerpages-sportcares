##### Learning to Move, Moving to Learn

By Special Olympics Singapore, Presented by Dr Teo-Koh Sock Miang

In the early years of life, children must learn to move and move to learn. Movement allows young children, with and without special needs, to explore and learn from the environment, Early control and management of the body in different environments is crucial for young children as movement competency can help to build self-confidence and self-esteem. Competent movement is also necessary for daily living. Early movement competency can also open up a world of play and play interactions with others. Learning to move and learning through movement help children to develop cognitively, socially, emotionally and physically.

In this workshop, participants will learn about the importance of helping children develop competent fundamental movement skills. Basic principles and considerations for providing a multi-disciplinary fundamental movement environment for young children will also be shared during the hands on session.
