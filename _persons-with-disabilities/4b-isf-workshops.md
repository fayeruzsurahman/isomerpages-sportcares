#### Amazing FMS Race (By Yellow Marketing)

Participants will race around the Inclusive Sports Festival site performing challenges at different legs. Complete each leg to find the clue to the next destination. We will be testing their knowledge in para sports, national day trivia and fundamental movement skills. Complete all legs and collect your mini FMS prize!

The different legs will include:
* 3 Para Sports Activities
* 1 Hopscotch Warrior
* 1 National Trivia

(Activities to be confirmed)

The purpose of this race is for participants to travel across around the Festival to see the different sports and activities involved with ISF. More importantly involve them in the games so they can better understand and empathize for people with disabilities and the importance of sports in their lives.  

Participants can collect a mini prize from a toy capsule machine when they are done!
