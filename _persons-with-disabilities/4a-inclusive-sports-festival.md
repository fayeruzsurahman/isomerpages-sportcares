Inclusive Sports Festival (ISF) is Singaporeâ€™s largest inclusive sports event, and is part of GetActive! Singapore, a nationwide effort to celebrate national day through sport.

In its third edition this year, ISF has evolved from a gathering of sports tryouts for persons with disabilities (PWDs) to a partner-led event offering workshops, niche and experiential sports and activities for the disability community. More than 15 event partners are coming together to provide 37 different activities across three levels of Our Tampines Hub.

The 2019 edition brings back popular activities like curling, canoeing, and scuba diving, and features over 10 new activities including:

*	Cycling by Ageless Bicyclists
*	Augmented Reality Games by HADO
*	Dialogue in the Dark
*	Sports Climbing Level 1 Certification by The Rock School
*	Drowning Prevention and Aquatic Safety by Aquafins

ISF is an opportunity for people from all walks of life to try out disability sports and learn how sports can build an inclusive society.
