Since 2016, we have undertaken the executor role of the Disability Sports Master Plan (DSMP) as guided by the Ministry of Culture, Community, and Youth (MCCY). Find out more about the DSMP [here](https://www.mccy.gov.sg/Topics/Sports/Articles/DSMP.aspx).

As part of the DSMP, the first Centre of Expertise for disability sports – [Sengkang Sports Centre](https://www.myactivesg.com/facilities/sengkang-sports-centre) – was launched in 2016 together with the Yes! I Can Swimming programme. 4 other Centres of Expertise are scheduled for launch over the next 5 years.

We has since worked to increase accessibility of our sports centres and to provide more opportunities for persons with disabilities to live better through sport.
