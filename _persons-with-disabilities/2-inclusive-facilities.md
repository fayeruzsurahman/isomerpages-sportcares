#### Overview
Over the next few years, [ActiveSG](https://www.myactivesg.com/About-ActiveSG) is committed to upgrading facilities and providing training to sport centre staff to make sports facilities more accessible to persons with disabilities and special needs. Please refer to the map above for the locations of our inclusive gyms and swimming pools.

#### Gyms
ActiveSG gymnasiums across Singapore are currently undergoing transformations to cater to people from all walks of life. New and upgraded ActiveSG gyms are equipped with specialised machines with adaptable features, such as removable seats for wheelchair users, and Natural Transmission pneumatic technology to ensure all movements, weight and resistance adjustments are safe and easy on the joints. 

Persons with disabilities, seniors, and beginner gym goers can seek the assistance of ActiveSG Fitness Instructors to create a specialised training plan utilising these machines.

Available at:
* Enabling Village
* Our Tampines Hub
* Heartbeat@Bedok
* Toa Payoh Sports Centre
* Jurong West Sports Centre

#### Swimming Pools
ActiveSG’s accessible swimming pools are fitted with ramps leading into the pools. Swimming pool wheelchairs are available at swimming complexes that have pools with ramps. Visitors may seek the assistance of the pool’s lifeguards or guest officers if they wish to use the swimming pool wheelchairs to enter the pool.
