### Overview

In 2012, SportCares was launched as a vision to change the lives of the vulnerable through the power of sport.

Initiated as part of the “Vision 2030: Live Better Through Sport” master plan, SportCares is rooted in the belief that positive sports experiences have the ability to transform the lives of youths-at-risk and the vulnerable in society. 

>At the heart of SportCares lies an unshakeable belief that things should be done with and alongside the community.  

When we first started out in 2013, we were supporting 90 at-risk youth. Today, we are mentoring more than 900 children and youths by using sports as a catalyst. The success of our sporting programmes has allowed us to widen our scope of care to include other beneficiaries from the society-at-large.  

In 2016, we expanded our focus to include persons with disabilities, seniors and low income families. 

As an organisation that keeps people at the heart of what we do, we continue to grow from strength to strength. What began as an idea to elevate the lives of Singapore’s underprivileged has since evolved into a sports-centric social integration programme.

Helping us realise our mission is a dedicated team of partners and collaborators comprising corporates, private foundations, social enterprises, social service organisations, schools, institutes of higher learnings and government agencies. Some of our distinguished partners include Changi Foundation (Changi Airport Group), Temasek Foundation Cares, Benchmark Sports, AXA Singapore, AWWA Ltd and the Special Olympics SIngapore, among others.
